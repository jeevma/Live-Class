    "\n",
    "In this module, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand what **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is and why it exists.\n",
    "2. Learn the **core building blocks** (Agents, Tools, Workflows, Memory, Callbacks, Dev UI/CLI).\n",
    "3. See the **architecture & mental model** (root agent, sub-agents, delegation).\n",
    "4. Explore **workflow patterns** (sequential, parallel, loop).\n",
    "5. Compare ADK with **LangChain/LangGraph**, **CrewAI**, and **Microsoft AutoGen**.\n",
    "6. Note **strengths, limitations, and gotchas** so you can pick the right tool for the job.\n",

    "## What is ADK (Agent Development Kit)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ADK** is a flexible, modular framework for building and deploying **AI agents**, optimized for **Gemini** but **model-agnostic** (you can also use GPT/Claude) and **deployment-agnostic** (local or cloud). It aims to make agent development feel like standard software engineering: clear configs, testable units, composable workflows, and an integrated developer experience (CLI + web UI).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key ideas**:\n",
    "- **Agents** are self-contained execution units that pursue goals, call tools, and can coordinate with other agents.\n",
    "- **Tools** give agents capabilities (search, code execution, RAG, custom Python functions, third-party APIs).\n",
    "- **Workflows** orchestrate agents (e.g., run in sequence, in parallel, or iterate in loops).\n",
    "- **Memory/Session State** lets agents carry context across steps/sessions.\n",
    "- **Callbacks/Guardrails** hook into lifecycle stages for safety, logging, and control.\n",
    "- **Dev Experience** includes an `adk` CLI and an interactive web UI for local testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll dive deeper into each of these in the next sections and hands-on modules."

    "## Core Concepts: Agents, Tools, Workflows, Memory, Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agents\n",
    "- An **Agent** is a goal-driven unit that can reason, call tools, and produce outputs.\n",
    "- A **root agent** is your entry point. It can delegate work to **sub-agents** specialized for tasks (research, coding, analysis, etc.).\n",
    "- Multi-agent systems in ADK are built by composing multiple agents with defined responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "- **Built-in tools** (e.g., Google Search, code executors, RAG) enable common capabilities out-of-the-box.\n",
    "- **Function tools** are custom Python functions you expose to agents.\n",
    "- **Third-party tools** or even **agents-as-tools** can be integrated for complex workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflows\n",
    "- **Sequential**: sub-agents run in a fixed order (A → B → C).\n",
    "- **Parallel**: sub-agents run concurrently and aggregate results.\n",
    "- **Loop**: iterate until a condition or iteration budget is met (e.g., refine a draft until it passes checks).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory & Session State\n",
    "- Persist useful state across turns or app restarts (e.g., user profile, intermediate artifacts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callbacks / Guardrails\n",
    "- Hook into agent lifecycle (before/after tool calls, on error) to enforce constraints, redact data, or log decisions."
