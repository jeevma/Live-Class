    "### 1) Coordinator / Dispatcher\n",
    "- **Structure:** One LLM **Coordinator** routes to specialists.\n",
    "- **Use when:** Requests span distinct domains; you want simple routing rules.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2) Sequential Pipeline\n",
    "- **Structure:** `SequentialAgent([A, B, C])`.\n",
    "- **Use when:** Deterministic multi-step flow; each step consumes prior outputs.\n",
    "- **Mechanisms:** Shared state (`output_key` → read later). Reinforced in transcript: sequentially wrap work then synthesize.\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "flowchart LR\n",
    "  A[Validate] --> B[Process] --> C[Synthesize]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Parallel Fan-Out / Gather\n",
    "- **Structure:** `ParallelAgent` runs independent tasks; a later step aggregates.\n",
    "- **Use when:** Independent fetch/compute tasks can run concurrently to reduce latency.\n",
    "- **Mechanisms:** Distinct state keys per child; subsequent step reads them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "flowchart TB\n",
    "  P[ParallelAgent]\n",
    "  P --> A1[Fetch A]\n",

    "  A1 & A2 & A3 --> S[Synthesizer]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Hierarchical Task Decomposition\n",
    "- **Structure:** Multi-level tree; higher levels split goals and assign sub-tasks.\n",
    "- **Use when:** Complex problems benefit from structured breakdown.\n",
    "- **Mechanisms:** Delegation across hierarchy; results bubble up.\n",

    "- **Structure:** `SequentialAgent([Generator, Reviewer])`.\n",
    "- **Use when:** You want a quality gate or factual check.\n",
    "- **Mechanisms:** Generator writes to state; Critic reads it and approves/rejects.\n",

    "  G[Generate Draft] --> C[Review / Critique]\n",
    "  C -->|feedback| G\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Iterative Refinement (Loop)\n",
    "- **Structure:** `LoopAgent` wraps steps to refine output.\n",
    "- **Use when:** You need multiple passes; stop via max iterations or criteria.\n",
    "- **Mechanisms:** Shared state across iterations; optionally escalate to stop.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)\n",
    "- **Structure:** Pause for human approval or input mid-flow.\n",
